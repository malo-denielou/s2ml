=========

Files:

S3.session            Local session roles code
example3c.ml          Customer user code
example3s.ml          Store user code
example3o.ml          Officer user code
example3a.ml          Symbolic user code

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

'make'     to build the concrete and symbolic Ocaml executables
           creates the following files:
                   * example3c.exe
                   * example3c-bc.exe
                   * example3s.exe
                   * example3s-bc.exe
                   * example3o.exe
                   * example3o-bc.exe
                   * example3a.exe
                   * example3a-bc.exe

'make fs'  to build the concrete F# executable
           creates the following files:
                   * example3c.exe
                   * example3s.exe
                   * example3o.exe

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
====================

Concrete run:   In 3 different terminals, run example3s.exe and example3o.exe,
                and only then example3c.exe. If the Ocaml version was built, it
                is possible to use the bytecode versions in the same way.

Symbolic run:   Run example3a.exe in a terminal.
